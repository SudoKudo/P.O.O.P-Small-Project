You should have your slides and support material on a USB stick. All members must participate in the presentation.

The slides must be professional and start with a title page followed by a members page. Then you should explain what the project is, how it was developed, 
and anything that you feel is important. UML and/or ER diagrams are required. Leave time for questions and have a questions page.
